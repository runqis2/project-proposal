#Project description 
  For the final project, I want to do a connect-four game using cinder and c++. It will be a graphic game board that displays what is going on with the game and 
  allows players to make their moves. I plan to have 3 different AI players that has level settings: easy, medium, and pro. I want to do this project because when I
  started coding, a connect four board was one of my first projects, but it was not playable, just like the TTT assignment. So I want to make it a actual game.
  
#Planned Time Line
  For week one, I plan to complete the game board codes and basic game functions (e.g. check winner & move). 
  For week two, I plan to make textures and graphics of the game. By the end of week two, the game should be a playable app that the player can choose to compete 
    with a random AI player or another human player.
  For week three, I plan to implement the AI players (Minmax). I will also try to find any flaws in the game and add some extra features like music and sounds.
  
#Stretch Goals
  Even I seriously doubt that I will have extra time, I plan to make it a 3D game. Since the connect-four game board is vertical, making it 3D and allow the user to
  view the board through different angles by mouse drags would be cool.
